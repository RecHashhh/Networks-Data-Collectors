Game Title: "Network Data Collectors" by William Garzon | RecHashh
The provided code is an assembly language program for the DOS platform. The game is 
titled "Network Data Collectors" and was developed by William Garzon. Below is a 
detailed description of the code and its function:
Game Features:
"Network Data Collectors" is an adventure game where the player controls a ship that 
collects data in a cybernetic network called the Grid. The objective is to collect 1000 
data points to save the network. The game includes obstacles such as viruses and 
barriers that the player must avoid. The player can also pause or exit the game.

Characteristics:
• Stack Segment:
The stack segment reserves 512 bytes for the stack using a filling pattern 'DADA007'. 
This is useful for debugging, allowing to see how much of the stack is utilized. If more 
than 512 bytes are used, the written data will overwrite this pattern, helping to identify 
overflow issues.
• Menu Segment:
The menu segment defines strings that will be printed on the screen during program 
execution. It includes the game title, plot description, instructions for playing, and 
messages displayed in different game states such as start, pause, success, and failure. 
It also defines variables for barriers, speed, score, and the maximum number of data 
needed to win the game.
• Code Segment
The main code segment defines the main code segment of the game. The code segment 
is assumed for the code segment register (CS), stack (SS), and menu data (DS). The 
`ORG 0100H` instruction leaves the first 256 memory locations free (0x100 in 
hexadecimal), which is a common practice in DOS programs. The label `START` jumps 
to the `Main` label, where the main logic of the game begins.
• Key Constants:
Defined key constants include `kESC` for exit, `kENTER` to start, and arrow keys to 
move the cursor or ship within the game. Left and right limits for ship movement are 
also defined.
• Macros:
Defined macros simplify repetitive operations in the game code. These macros include:
- `setCur`: Positions the cursor at a specific row and column using the corresponding 
BIOS interrupt.
- `stpChrT`: Prints a character in TTY mode, updating the cursor position after printing.
- `stpChrC`: Prints a specific number of characters with a determined color.
- `stpChrBN`: Prints a character in black and white.
- `Random`: Generates a random number between 0 and 9.
• Main Loop:
The main loop of the game runs in the `Main` section. It initializes the game, clears the 
screen, prints game instructions, and waits for the player to press a key to start. Then, 
the main loop runs, controlling the game and handling player input to move the ship or 
perform other actions.
• Conclusion:
In summary, the provided code is an assembly language game program for the DOS 
platform. The game "Network Data Collectors" is an adventure game developed by 
William Garzon. The code defines stack, menu, and main code segments, and utilizes 
macros to simplify repetitive operations. The game includes features such as data 
collection, obstacle handling, and pauses, and runs in a main loop that controls the 
game and handles player input
